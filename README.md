# Welcome - I'm Gray135

I'm a self-taught Excel and data enthusiast with 8+ years of experience in customer experience, digital support, and quality. I've been using data to spot patterns, reduce churn, and improve the customer journey. Lately, I’ve been sharpening my technical skills by building hands-on projects in:

- Excel (logic modeling, churn & engagement strategies)
- Power BI (interactive dashboards)
- SQL (data cleaning, joins, subqueries)
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, customer analysis)
