# Hi, I'm Aaron (Gray135)

I'm a self-taught Excel Analyst with 8+ years of experience in customer experience, digital support, and quality. I specialize in using data to uncover insights, reduce churn, and improve customer outcomes. Right now, I'm focused on growing my technical skills through real-world projects using:

- Excel (logic modeling, churn & engagement strategies)
- Power BI (interactive dashboards)
- SQL (data cleaning, joins, subqueries)
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, customer analysis)
